# Sorting-Algorithms-Analysis
A Java application that visualizes sorting techniques including Merge Sort, Quick Sort, 
Heap Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, and Insertion Sort
# What I Learned
* Runtime anaylsis of algorithms using randomly generated arrays
* Visualization of runtime using JAVA FX
* Merge, Quick, Heap having a time complexity of O(n logn)
* Selection, Bubble, Insertion having a time complexity of O(n^2)
